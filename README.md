# TalismanAngularClient

This is an Angular front-end for my Talisman Magic and Sword application. For now, I am focusing more on back-end side of this application
so this one is more like a demo. Currently, there are no tests(although I plan to create many of them 
when I will focus more on it), website is very basic, without many options. I plan to constantly upgrade this
project and I hope that soon it will be much more complex.

## Website

Although this website is still under creation, you can check current version here: https://talisman-angular-client.vercel.app/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
